# GestureRecognition
Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning

Problem Statement:
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie

Your task is to train a model on the 'train' folder which performs well on the 'val' folder as well (as usually done in ML projects). We have withheld the test folder for evaluation purposes - your final model's performance will be tested on the 'test' set.
